# Meditations: dimzat | Reflection 
This project was quite infuriating at times due to the complexity of javascript compared to the simplicity of the markup languages HTML and CSS. This was a good refresher for my JS knowledge and a reminder that 
[Job's not finished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY7l2pcxdHM). Apart from that I will admit that I could have spent some extra time cleaning up some more or adding some more features but this is one of those things where after
a while you just feel disgusted to even look at the code and want to move on. Like the girl you bring home from the bar and... Maybe that analogy is not appropriate here. My apologies.
## Main Takeaways (Mmmmhmhmm I could really eat some takeaway biohacked food rn)
- Javascript is frustrating
- I can start to see the holy trinity of JS, CSS and HTML and how it works on the web
## Future Improvements
- Skip creating elements in HTML and manipulating them using JS and instead completely create DOM dynamically using JS.
- Plan out code more often either using comments at the beginning of functions or outside. I really struggled following the planning aspect of code.
